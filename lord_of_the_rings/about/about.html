    <h1>About The Lord of the Rings</h1>    
    <p>The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during World War II. It is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold by 2007.</p>
